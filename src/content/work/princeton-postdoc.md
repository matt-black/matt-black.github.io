**Nanoscale Structure of the Mitotic Spindle** (2024-): 
Leveraged expansion microscopy and dual view light sheet imaging to construct nanoscale-resolution maps of the tubulin architecture of the vertebrate mitotic spindle. 

**Expansion Microscopy Deformation Correction** (2025-): Developed a novel protocol for *in situ* correction of spatial deformations that occur as a result of expansion microscopy.
