**Nanoscale Structure of the Mitotic Spindle**: 
Leveraged expansion microscopy and dual view light sheet imaging to construct nanoscale-resolution maps of the tubulin architecture of the vertebrate mitotic spindle. 

**Expansion Microscopy Deformation Correction**: Developed a novel protocol for *in situ* correction of spatial deformations that occur as a result of expansion microscopy. 

**Computational Tools for Multiview Microscopy**: Developed a suite of computational tools for multi-GPU deskewing, registering, and deconvolution of large volumes generated by multiview microscopes.
