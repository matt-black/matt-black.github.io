**Bacterial Fruiting Body Rheology**: 
Created a novel atomic force microscope (AFM)-based assy for rheological characterization of live \textit{M. xanthus} fruiting bodies. These measurements provided the first direct meaurement of activity-induced viscosity reduction in an active viscoelastic material.

**Influence of Capillary Forces on Gliding Bacteria**:
Engineered a device for controlling osmotic pressure in bio-compatible hydrogels. Used this device in combination with time-lapse surface profilometry and light microscopy to demonstrate how capillary forces influence the motion and population structure of gliding bacteria on hydrated surfaces. Programmed a neural network-based data analysis pipeline for cell segmentation and downstream statistical analysis. 

**Dense, Single Cell Tracking of Gliding Bacteria**:
Designed and implemented novel neural network architectures and algorithms for segmenting and tracking single bacteria in dense monolayers. Used this data to measure, at unprecedented time and labeling density, single- and multicellular motility of gliding bacteria when they are confined within dense, swarming monolayers.
