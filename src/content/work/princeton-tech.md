**Single Cell Responses to sub-MIC Antibiotics** (2016-2017):
Combined time-lapse fluorescence photomicroscopy and quantitative image analysis to characterize the intracellular response of single \textit{E. coli} cells to sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations of DNA damage-inducing antibiotics.

**Collective Motility and Antibiotic Response of Bacteria** (2016-2017):
Used microfluidics and quantitative light microscopy to characterize how structured environments affect both the collective motility and emergence of antibiotic resistance in populations of free-swimming \textit{E. coli}.
