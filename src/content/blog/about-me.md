# Welcome to My Website!

Hello and welcome! 

## About Me

I'm a research scientist and engineer.
I'm especially interested in experimental biophysics and its intersection with modern machine learning and signal processing techniques.
I hope to use these interests to build the next generation of drugs, medical devices, and other biomedical innovations.

In 2024, I earned my Ph.D. in Quantitative and Computational Biology from Princeton University. 
I conducted my doctoral work in the lab of Dr. Joshua Shaevitz where I worked on understanding how active matter physics influences and determines the collective behaviors of the model social bacteria, *Myxococcus xanthus*.
In order to do so, I had to develop new techniques in both force and light microscopy. 
I then coupled these techniques to novel machine learning algorithms and pipelines to extract data at heretoforth unseen scale and precision. 
For details on the main academic papers generated during my Ph. D., see [here](../blog/publications/afm_rheology) and [here](../blog/publications/capillary_forces).

Since then, I've been working in the lab of Dr. Sabine Petry where I am working to create the first-ever nanoscale map of the vertebrate mitotic spindle's tubulin architecture alongside the many microtubule nucleators, motors, and crosslinkers that determine its function. 
To do this, I am developing new expansion microscopy techniques that allow me to physically swell fixed, mitotic cells to over 1000x their original volume. 
I am combining this with dual-view light sheet microscopy, which allows me to image these expanded cells with spatially-isotropic resolution. 
Unfortunately, the physical swelling of these samples induces physical deformations into these samples.
To correct for these deformations, I am developing a protocol that will allow me to correct for these deformations and restore the sample's native geometry.
Finally, I am creating new computational tools for bandwidth extrapolation in fluorescence microscopy, allowing researchers to image sparse biological samples at high resolution without the complexities of traditional superresolution techniques such as PALM/STORM or STED. 

In my free time, I am an avid runner and cyclist. 
I especially enjoy spending time in nature: trail running, mountain biking, and hiking.
