I'm a biophysicist and engineer interested in cell biology, machine learning, and microscopy. 
I'm currently a postdoctoral scientist in the labs of Drs. Sabine Petry and Josh Shaevitz, where I am using expansion microscopy to create the first nanoscale spatial map of the human mitotic spindle capable of resolving both individual microtubules as well as the many microtubule-associated proteins (*e.g.* motors, nucleators, crosslinkers) that enable spindle function.
Outside of the lab, I am an avid runner and cyclist.
